## Portal Checkbox to Graph API Mapping

When you select **"Guest or external users"** in a CA policy, the Entra portal shows six checkboxes. This table maps each portal label to its Graph API value and CA type name used throughout this document.

| Portal Checkbox Label | Graph API value (`guestOrExternalUserTypes`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ☑ **B2B collaboration guest users** | `b2bCollaborationGuest` | ⚠️ Heterogeneous — contains both Entra-backed AND non-Entra guests (Google, OTP, SAML). Use basic `mfa` only. |
| ☑ **B2B collaboration member users** | `b2bCollaborationMember` | Entra-backed only. Auth strength safe. |
| ☑ **B2B direct connect users** | `b2bDirectConnectUser` | Entra-backed only. Auth strength safe. Requires inbound trust — else blocked. |
| ☑ **Local guest users** | `internalGuest` | Lives in your directory. Auth strength safe. |
| ☑ **Service provider users** | `serviceProvider` | GDAP/CSP partners. MFA always from home tenant. Auth strength applicable. |
| ☑ **Other external users** | `otherExternalUser` | Non-Entra IdP only. Auth strength NOT supported. Basic `mfa` only. |

## Recommended Two-Policy Split

The six types cannot all share the same grant control because `b2bCollaborationGuest` and `otherExternalUser` cannot safely use authentication strength — applying it blocks them silently instead of prompting for MFA.

### Policy 1 — `IAC - GLOBAL - GRANT - MFA - B2B-Guests` (Authentication Strength)

**Portal selections — Guest or external users — Include:**

| Checkbox | Select? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| B2B collaboration guest users | ☐ **No** | Heterogeneous — non-Entra guests would be blocked by auth strength |
| B2B collaboration member users | ☑ **Yes** | Entra-backed only, auth strength safe |
| B2B direct connect users | ☑ **Yes** | Entra-backed only — confirm inbound trust configured first |
| Local guest users | ☑ **Yes** | Local directory account, full method set |
| Service provider users | ☑ **Yes** | GDAP home tenant MFA auto-trusted |
| Other external users | ☐ **No** | Non-Entra only — auth strength not supported |

**Grant control:** Authentication strength → `Modern MFA + TAP` (WHfB, FIDO2, CBA, TAP)

> ✅ This matches the screenshot configuration — 5 selected with **B2B collaboration guest users unchecked**. That is the correct selection for this policy.

---

### Policy 2 — `IAC - GLOBAL - GRANT - MFA - Mixed-Guests` (Basic MFA)

**Portal selections — Guest or external users — Include:**

| Checkbox | Select? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| B2B collaboration guest users | ☑ **Yes** | Mixed population — basic MFA works for both Entra and non-Entra guests |
| B2B collaboration member users | ☐ **No** | Covered by Policy 1 |
| B2B direct connect users | ☐ **No** | Covered by Policy 1 |
| Local guest users | ☐ **No** | Covered by Policy 1 |
| Service provider users | ☐ **No** | Covered by Policy 1 |
| Other external users | ☑ **Yes** | Non-Entra only — basic MFA is the only supported control |

**Grant control:** Basic `mfa` (NOT authentication strength)

## Per-Type Reference

---

### B2B collaboration guest users — `b2bCollaborationGuest`

- **Portal label:** B2B collaboration guest users
- **UserType in directory:** Guest
- **Who:** Any user invited or redeemed via B2B collaboration. Includes **both** Entra-backed guests (external Entra tenant) and non-Entra guests (Google, Facebook, email OTP, SAML/WS-Fed). CA cannot distinguish between them.
- **MFA enforced by:** Either (resource tenant default; home tenant if inbound MFA trust configured) — for Entra-backed only. Non-Entra always uses resource tenant.

| Where MFA completes | Supported methods |
|---|---|
| **Resource tenant** | Authenticator push, OATH software token, SMS, Voice |
| **Home tenant** (trust required, Entra-backed only) | Authenticator push, Authenticator phone sign-in, OATH software, OATH hardware, FIDO2, Windows Hello for Business, CBA, SMS, Voice |

**Authentication strength support:** ❌ NOT safe for mixed populations. Auth strength will block non-Entra guests instead of prompting them.
**Assign to:** Policy 2 — basic `mfa`

---

### B2B collaboration member users — `b2bCollaborationMember`

- **Portal label:** B2B collaboration member users
- **UserType in directory:** Member
- **Who:** External Entra users with member-level access. Always Entra-backed — no non-Entra variant.
- **MFA enforced by:** Either (resource tenant default; home tenant if inbound MFA trust configured)

| Where MFA completes | Supported methods |
|---|---|
| **Resource tenant** | Authenticator push, OATH software token, SMS, Voice |
| **Home tenant** (trust required) | Authenticator push, Authenticator phone sign-in, OATH software, OATH hardware, FIDO2, Windows Hello for Business, CBA, SMS, Voice |

**Authentication strength support:** ✅ Supported — Entra-backed only, no heterogeneity concern.
**Assign to:** Policy 1 — auth strength

---

### B2B direct connect users — `b2bDirectConnectUser`

- **Portal label:** B2B direct connect users
- **UserType in directory:** No user object — no presence in your directory
- **Who:** External Entra users accessing Teams Connect shared channels (only current use case)
- **MFA enforced by:** Home tenant — **MANDATORY**. Cannot complete MFA in resource tenant. Without inbound trust configured, user is **blocked entirely** — no prompt, no fallback.

| Where MFA completes | Supported methods |
|---|---|
| **Resource tenant** | ❌ Not possible — no user object in resource directory |
| **Home tenant** (trust REQUIRED) | Authenticator push, Authenticator phone sign-in, OATH software, OATH hardware, FIDO2, Windows Hello for Business, CBA, SMS, Voice |

**Authentication strength support:** ✅ Supported — home tenant methods only. Ensure allowed combinations include methods the partner tenant has enabled.
**Prerequisite before enabling:** Confirm inbound cross-tenant MFA trust is configured at **Entra ID → External Identities → Cross-tenant access settings → Inbound trust** for each partner tenant using Teams Connect.
**Assign to:** Policy 1 — auth strength

---

### Local guest users — `internalGuest`

- **Portal label:** Local guest users
- **UserType in directory:** Guest — but credentials live in your own directory
- **Who:** Legacy pre-B2B pattern. Account exists and is managed entirely in your tenant. No external home tenant.
- **MFA enforced by:** Resource tenant — **always**

| Where MFA completes | Supported methods |
|---|---|
| **Resource tenant** | All methods your tenant supports — full set including FIDO2, WHfB, CBA |
| **Home tenant** | ❌ Not applicable — no external home tenant |

**Authentication strength support:** ✅ Fully supported — account is local, no cross-tenant trust needed.
**Assign to:** Policy 1 — auth strength

---

### Service provider users — `serviceProvider`

- **Portal label:** Service provider users
- **UserType in directory:** External — isServiceProvider = true
- **Who:** GDAP/CSP partner technicians administering your tenant
- **MFA enforced by:** Home tenant — **always**. Hardcoded by Microsoft. Cannot be changed regardless of trust settings.

| Where MFA completes | Supported methods |
|---|---|
| **Resource tenant** | ❌ Not applicable — resource tenant MFA registration not supported for GDAP users |
| **Home tenant** (auto-trusted by Microsoft) | Any method the partner's home tenant supports |

**Authentication strength support:** ✅ Applicable — but home tenant methods only. Verify partner MFA methods align with your allowed combinations. If a partner only has SMS and your strength excludes SMS, they will be blocked.
**Assign to:** Policy 1 — auth strength

> ℹ️ GDAP home tenant MFA is always automatically trusted in the resource tenant — no cross-tenant trust configuration needed.

---

### Other external users — `otherExternalUser`

- **Portal label:** Other external users
- **UserType in directory:** External — does not fit any other category
- **Who:** External users not covered by the above types — typically non-Entra IdP users without a formal B2B invitation
- **MFA enforced by:** Resource tenant — **always**. No cross-tenant trust available.

| Where MFA completes | Supported methods |
|---|---|
| **Resource tenant** | Authenticator push, OATH software token, SMS, Voice |
| **Home tenant** | ❌ Not applicable |

**Authentication strength support:** ❌ NOT supported. Must use basic `mfa` grant control. Authentication strength will block these users.
**Assign to:** Policy 2 — basic `mfa`

---

## Authentication Strength — Accepted Methods by Location

Per Microsoft Learn (Authentication strength MFA methods for external users):

| Authentication method | Home tenant (trusted) | Resource tenant |
|---|---|---|
| SMS as second factor | ✅ | ✅ |
| Voice call | ✅ | ✅ |
| Microsoft Authenticator push notification | ✅ | ✅ |
| Microsoft Authenticator phone sign-in | ✅ | ❌ |
| OATH software token | ✅ | ✅ |
| OATH hardware token | ✅ | ❌ |
| FIDO2 security key | ✅ | ❌ |
| Windows Hello for Business | ✅ | ❌ |
| Certificate-based authentication (CBA) | ✅ | ❌ |

> FIDO2, WHfB, OATH hardware, and CBA are **home tenant only**. To enforce phishing-resistant methods, inbound MFA trust must be configured so the home tenant path is used.
